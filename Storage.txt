When we are using an contract all the variables and all are stored in the "storage" variables

So for example the we store the uint256 favouriteNumber = 25 , bool someBool , uint256[] myArray;
In this case 1. The favouriteNumber and bool will be stored in storage variables
             2. While the array wont be stored in the storage variable but the length of the array will be stored there 
             3. While all the variables which are defined under a function they wont be stored in the storage , they will be created when function is running.
             4. And constant and immutable variables also wont be stored in the storage variable

             And to check the storage Layout of the contract
